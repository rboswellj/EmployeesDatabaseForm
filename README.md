This is an assignment for my C#2 class. It uses a windows form to interact with a
SQL Express localDB server. 

The relative pathing is not yet set up on the DB, so you may need to relink the connection
string to the absolute pathing wherever you download the folder. The mdf for the database
is located one step above the solution root directory, in the cSharpSQLDb directory.
It is called Employees.md
